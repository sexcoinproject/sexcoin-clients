Sexcoin QT Clients v0.6.4.1-RC1-beta
================================

Windows
-------
The Sexcoin-QT Windows binaries in this release are all inclusive and should
NOT require any dependencies. The binaries were build on a 32-bit architecture
but testing shows it runs fine on 64-bit systems as well. 

Linux 32-bit and 64-bit
-----------------------
Both binaries (sexcoin-qt and sexcoind) were built on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The 
dependency requirements are listed below. These binaries should run fine on 
older releases of Ubuntu, however they were only tested on 12.04 LTS with the
specific library versions of ...

Boost v1.48
Berkeley DB v4.8
OpenSSL v1.0.1c

*If you are having problems getting libdb4.8 to install due to it not being
included in the 12.04 release, please see the following site which is used
for the Bitcoin-QT builds. The needed libs are provided for most current
Ubuntu releases as well as 12.04.
